# Allbert Homebrew formula (v0.62 M2). Lives in the tap repo
# (lexlapax/homebrew-allbert) at release time; kept here as the source of
# truth. A FORMULA (not a cask) because Allbert wants `brew services` support
# for `allbert serve` (cask has no service block) and ships prebuilt
# per-platform binaries (the HashiCorp-tap pattern; homebrew-core's
# no-source-builds rule does not apply to third-party taps).
#
# The url/sha256 blocks are filled from the GitHub release + SHA256SUMS at
# release time (M8 / CI). Placeholders below are replaced by the release job.
